# ScreenRecorder
The Screen Recorder App is a fully offline, privacy-respecting Android application that allows users to record their device's screen with advanced features such as custom video settings, in-app editing, and more. This app is designed with user privacy in mind, meaning it does not require internet access or any privacy-invasive permissions.
